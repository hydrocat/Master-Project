\section{Code Re-structure}
\subsection{Administrative Resources}
Currently, resource filtering is implemented by having a small set of controllers that are eligible to handle non-administrative users however this led to some confusion because its response structure does not follow the \gls{HATEOAS} convention.

Some re-structuring could be done at the repository level by configuring the authorization mechanism to filter \gls{HTTP} methods based on the current user's requesting role.

Ultimately, all resources should follow the \gls{HATEOAS} pattern so that the complexity of the front-end application is lower.
