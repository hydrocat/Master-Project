Firstly, I would like to thank my friends Daniel Costa Valério, Henrique Pinheiro and Sávio Camacam. Together we formed the HEDANVISA group, not only sharing technical knowledge but also forming long-lasting relations.

I would like to also thank both institutions, \gls{UTFPR} and \gls{IPB} for the opportunity of realizing my masters in the scope of a double degree program.

Special thanks Professor Marcos Silvano for enabling Computer Science students of \gls{UTFPR}, Campo Mourão to apply for this program and to Bruno Mendes for his clarifying explanations in regards to writing this document.
