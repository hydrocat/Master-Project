In the context of Polytechnical Institute of Bragan√ßa during student registration time, the information technology department is found to be frequently interrupted in order to attend inquiries regarding the information stored in their databases.

To mitigate this, Yabi was developed. It is a Web application built with Angular Framework for the user interface and Java with Spring for the functionalities. In general it provides a portal in which the institution's employees can access the information found in its databases without the need to have technical knowledge.

The developed application is found to attend most of the elicited requirements to be considered useful and offers a foundation for future improvements.
